# hand-gesture-recognition
A project for my PROG2051 Artificial Intelligence course at NTNU to classify and recognise over 2000 different hand gestures using AI, ML and image processing.
```
How to use:
The zipped image file size is 22MB, and can be found under 'images'. The images are 207x207 in size.
The dataset can also be found on Kaggle <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ritikagiridhar/2000-hand-gestures>.
You do not need to download the images, just use the command in the code as is. 
If you want to download them, they will be downloaded as a ZIP file. There are 8 subfolders.
Install all dependencies and run main.
```

For more information about the project and/or how I sourced the images, read the attached report or contact at e1900278@edu.vamk.fi :)
