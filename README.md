# hand-gesture-recognition
A project for my PROG2051 Artificial Intelligence course at NTNU to classify and recognise over 2000 different hand gestures using AI, ML and image processing.
```
How to use:
The image file is very large (3.7GB), and is hosted on <https://huggingface.co/datasets/trashsock/hands-images/tree/main>.
You do not need to download the images, just use the URL in the code as is. 
If you want to download them, they will be downloaded as a ZIP file. There are 8 subfolders.
Install all dependencies and run main.
```
